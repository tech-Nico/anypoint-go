Go implementation of a command line tool to access and manage MuleSoft cloud (and on-prem) entities like APIs, applications, runtimes, etc..
 
  Rationale:
   
- Allow me to build my first go application
- The official anypoint-cli tool is written in nodejs which requires a lot of dependencies. In some circumstances (ex: restricted environments) this is not desirable. Go allows you to build executable for various platform for several architectures (Mac, Linux, Windows) from the same codebase
